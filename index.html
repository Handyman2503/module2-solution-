                <p class="text1">A chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a
                   kind of domesticated bird. It is raised in many places
                   for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans
                   as livestock. Most breeds of chickens can fly for a short
                   distance. Some sleep in trees if there are trees around.</p>

                    <p class="text1">Beef cattle are bred and raised specifically
                       to provide meat or beef. Steers are the best type for this
                       purpose because they can be kept in herds without fighting
                       each other. Heifers are also often used for beef, especially
                       those that are not suitable to be used in a breeding herd.</p>

                        <p class="text1">Sushi (寿司) is a traditional food from Japan.
                           It is a popular dish in other countries as well, such as the
                           US, Canada, and the UK, along with many other countries.
                           The word "Sushi" comes from the Japanese word "Su" (酢)
                           meaning vinegar, and "Meshi" (飯), meaning rice. </p>
